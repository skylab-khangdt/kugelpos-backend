Common Schema Definitions

This module defines base schema classes used throughout the master-data service.
These base classes are inherited and extended by API v1 specific schema classes.
They are designed to maintain consistency in schema structure and facilitate
migration between versions.

Each class extends Pydantic's BaseModel and is used for FastAPI request/response
validation and automatic documentation generation.
