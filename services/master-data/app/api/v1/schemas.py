API V1 Request and Response Schema Definitions

This module defines all request and response schemas used in the API v1 of the master-data service.
These schemas inherit from base schema classes (BaseXXX) defined in common/schemas.py and
can be extended as needed.

Each class extends Pydantic's BaseModel and is used for FastAPI request/response validation
and automatic documentation generation.
